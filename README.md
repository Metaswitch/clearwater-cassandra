clearwater-cassandra
====================

Debian package build tools for Cassandra.

The clearwater-cassandra package makes the foillowing modifications to Cassandra's files:

* updates the init.d script to run in the signaling namespace, if one is configured
* updates the cassandra-env.sh file to disable/enable IPv6 based on our local_ip setting, as described at https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/JmxGotchas
* updates /etc/default/cassandra and /usr/share/cassandra/cassandra.in.sh to explicitly use Java 7, to ease upgrade from old systems which may already have had Java 6 installed

If we take a newer version of Cassandra, we should apply the same modifications to the newer versions of these scripts. We should also check that the cassandra.yaml and the cassandra-rackdc.properties files generated by the clustering plugin are right.
